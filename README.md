# SlimeboundMod
The Slimebound mod primarily features a new character, the Slimebound, to Slay the Spire.  This character attempts to stay within the bounds of vanilla Slay the Spire character design while still exploring new mechanics.

# **Features**

- Theme-forward design.  The Slimebound has hidden secrets and interactions with slime-related things in the Spire, and has cards for every slime enemy attack in the game (Corrosive Spit, Flame Tackle, Goop Spray, etc.)

- Full suite of 75 cards, plus 24 additional cards outside of it's card pool that can be generated through one of it's subthemes, the 'Spire Boss' mechanic.

- A tuned and balanced character, who can perform well with strong draft synergy, but can falter just as easily as vanilla characters.

- 4 new Potions, some of which are added to the base Potion pool.

- 9 new Relics, some of which are added to the base Relic pool.

- 2 Modifiers to vanilla Events, with thematic interactions with a slime-based character.

- 1 Brand new event that can only appear while playing as The Slimebound.

- Lots of custom or altered visual effects for cards.

- Secrets and easter eggs abound!

# **Character Mechanics**

**Split:** The Slimebound can form mini slimelings by sacrificing its health.  Slimelings attack at the start of each turn and have a variety of effects.  Like the Defect, many cards can interact with slimelings, such as triggering their effects, buffing them, or making them step in front of an incoming attack.

**Slimed:** A new debuff, Slimed, is applied by a wide variety of Slimebound cards and effects.  This debuff increases the damage of the next Attack an enemy receives, consuming the Slimed stack, and healing the Slimebound for half of the stack.  If not used by the end of the turn, half of the stack is dropped, so be sure to set it up and consume it with a one-two punch in a single turn.  Slimed is the predominant way the Slimebound heals back the HP loss from other cards in combat.

**Tackle:** Potent attacks that are tuned higher than average for their energy costs, but deal damage back to the Slimebound on use.  Several cards refer to and benefit Tackle cards, allowing them to scale mid-combat if heavily drafted.

**Self-Damage:** Between Splitting, Tackling, and other mechanics, the Slimebound often uses its HP for gains.  This is explored in further mechanics, such as benefits that trigger when you lose HP on your turn, or effects that prevent that HP loss and redirect it to enemies.

**0-Cost:** The Slimebound features many 0-cost cards, most of which Exhaust, along with a few cards that can return 0-cost Exhausted cards to your hand.  Included in this are a series of Lick cards - 0-cost Exhaust Skills which apply Slimed and a variety of other effects, and interact with other cards in the Slimebound kit.

## **Sub Themes**

**Poison:** As the Slimebound is thematically an Acid Slime, it is only fitting it has access to a small collection of Poison cards - enough to draft into a Poison-forward deck if desired.

**Spire Boss:** Two cards feature "Spire Boss" card generation, which involve the slime studying the bosses of the Spire and utilizing their skills, powers, and attacks.

**Card Morphing:** Several cards allow for the exhausting of cards in hand and replacing them with new cards, potentially helping out a bad draw or thinning out basics, statuses, or curses during a drawn-out fight.
